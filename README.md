Currently I am getting an error thrown in the line_items_controller- my /app/controllers/concerns/current_group.rb file contains the "current_group" module. However, referencing this with the includes line in line_items_controller leads to an error. I'm unsure if this is a simple spelling mistake somewhere along the way or something more difficult to spot.
